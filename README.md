# Introduction to C Sharp

* Download Mono for Mac: http://www.mono-project.com/download/
* There is a Xamarin IDE: https://xamarin.com/download/
* You can also `brew install mono`

## 1. How to Compile

* To compile an application, we need to run `mcs myClass.cs`
* This stands for **make c sharp** + `myClass.cs`
* This will compile `myClass.cs` into a new executable called `myClass.exe`

## 2. How to Run

* `mono myClass.exe`
